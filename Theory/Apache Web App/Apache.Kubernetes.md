# Deploy and Manage a "Hello Web App" (Apache httpd) on Kubernetes

**Name:** Sourabh Saini
**Roll No:** R2142230968
**Course:** Containerization and DevOps
## Objective

Deploy and manage a simple Apache-based web server using Kubernetes and:
- Verify it is running
- Modify it
- Scale it
- Debug it

---

## Prerequisites

- Kubernetes cluster running locally (e.g., Minikube or Kind)
- `kubectl` CLI installed and configured
- Basic familiarity with terminal/command line

---

## Task 1: Deploy a Simple Web Application (Apache httpd)

### Step 1: Run a Pod

Run an Apache (`httpd`) container as a standalone Pod:

```bash
kubectl run apache-pod --image=httpd
```
![alt text](image.png)
**Check** that the Pod is running:

```bash
kubectl get pods
```
![alt text](image-1.png)

> **Expected Output:** The `apache-pod` should appear with status `Running`.

---

### Step 2: Inspect the Pod

Get detailed information about the Pod:

```bash
kubectl describe pod apache-pod
```
![alt text](image-2.png)
**Focus on:**
- `container image` = `httpd`
- `ports` (default: 80)
- `events` section for any errors

---

### Step 3: Access the App

Forward local port `8081` to the Pod's port `80`:

```bash
kubectl port-forward pod/apache-pod 8081:80
```
![alt text](image-3.png)
Open your browser and navigate to:

```
http://localhost:8081
```
![alt text](image-4.png)

> **Expected Result:** Apache default page displaying **"It works!"**

---

### Step 4: Delete the Pod

```bash
kubectl delete pod apache-pod
```
![alt text](image-5.png)

> **Insight:** The Pod disappears **permanently** — there is no self-healing. If the Pod dies, it stays dead.

---

## Task 2: Convert to Deployment

### Step 5: Create a Deployment

```bash
kubectl create deployment apache --image=httpd
```
![alt text](image-6.png)
**Check** the deployment and its Pods:

```bash
kubectl get deployments
kubectl get pods
```
![alt text](image-7.png)
---

### Step 6: Expose the Deployment

Create a Service to expose the deployment:

```bash
kubectl expose deployment apache --port=80 --type=NodePort
```
![alt text](image-8.png)
Access it via port-forward:

```bash
kubectl port-forward service/apache 8082:80
```
![alt text](image-11.png)
Open your browser:

```
http://localhost:8082
```
![alt text](image-10.png)
> **Expected Result:** Apache default page — same as before, but now served through a **Service** (better abstraction than direct Pod access).

---

## Task 3: Modify Behavior

### Step 7: Scale the Deployment

Scale the deployment to 2 replicas:

```bash
kubectl scale deployment apache --replicas=2
```
![alt text](image-12.png)
**Check** that multiple Pods are running:

```bash
kubectl get pods
```
![alt text](image-13.png)
> **Observe:** Two Pods are now running the same Apache server.

---


## Task 4: Debugging Scenario

### Step 9: Break the App Intentionally

Set a wrong image to simulate a deployment failure:

```bash
kubectl set image deployment/apache httpd=wrongimage
```
![alt text](image-14.png)
**Check** Pod status:

```bash
kubectl get pods
```
![alt text](image-15.png)
> **Expected:** You will see Pods in a broken state (e.g., `ImagePullBackOff` or `ErrImagePull`).

---

### Step 10: Diagnose the Issue

Describe the broken Pod to find error details:

```bash
kubectl describe pod <pod-name>
```
![alt text](image-16.png)

**Look for:**
- `ImagePullBackOff` status
- Error messages in the `Events` section

---

### Step 11: Fix the App

Restore the correct image:

```bash
kubectl set image deployment/apache httpd=httpd
```
![alt text](image-17.png)
> **Verify:** Run `kubectl get pods` again — Pods should recover and show `Running`.

---

## Task 5: Explore Inside the Container

### Step 12: Exec into a Pod

Open an interactive shell inside the running container:

```bash
kubectl exec -it <pod-name> -- /bin/bash
```
![alt text](image-18.png)
**Inside the container**, list the web files:

```bash
ls /usr/local/apache2/htdocs
```

> This directory is where Apache serves its web content from.

**Exit the container:**

```bash
exit
```

---

## Task 6: Observe Self-Healing

### Step 13: Delete One Pod

```bash
kubectl delete pod <one-pod-name>
```
![alt text](image-19.png)
**Watch** in real-time as Kubernetes recreates the Pod automatically:

```bash
kubectl get pods -w
```
![alt text](image-20.png)
> **Insight:** The Deployment controller detects the missing Pod and immediately spins up a new one — this is **self-healing**.

---

## Task 7: Cleanup

Remove all resources created in this lab:

```bash
kubectl delete deployment apache
kubectl delete service apache
```

## Kubernetes Commands Summary

### 1. Run & Basic Pod Management

| Command | Purpose | Explanation |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| `kubectl run apache-pod --image=httpd` | Create a Pod | Runs a single Apache container directly. Quick test only. |
| `kubectl get pods` | List Pods | Shows all running Pods in current namespace. |
| `kubectl describe pod apache-pod` | Inspect Pod | Detailed info: image, ports, events, errors. |

## Key Beginner Insights

### Pod vs Deployment

| | Pod | Deployment |
|-|-----|------------|
| Recovery | ❌ No (temporary) | ✅ Yes (self-healing) |
| Use case | Quick testing | Production workloads |
| Auto-restart | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |

### Port Forwarding
- ✅ Only for **debugging**
- ❌ **Not** for real/production exposure

### Service
- ✅ Stable access point
- ✅ Required for real applications

### Scaling
- Multiple Pods = better availability & fault tolerance

### Debugging
- `kubectl describe` is your **best friend**
